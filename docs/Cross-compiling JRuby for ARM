	Sometime Cross-compiling an project just need to set the environment variables to the ARM toolchain and building the system. This didnt worked with JRuby for me. The easy thing which I did to cross-compile is, I set the symbolic links gcc,g++,ld and ar which points to some Intel based gcc compiler on PC by default like gcc-4.6, etc to the respective binary in the toolchain. I used opensource arm-linux-gnueabi toolchain on ubuntu system. 

To download toolchain-
  apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi
  apt-get install g++-arm-linux-gnueabi

Link the toolchain- 
	cd /usr/bin
	mkdir ARM-binary
	cd ARM-binary
	ln -s ../arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc gcc
	ln -s ../arm-linux-gnueabi-g++ g++
	ln -s ../arm-linux-gnueabi-ld ld
	ln -s ../arm-linux-gnueabi-ar ar
	

To compile the jruby-
	PATH=/usr/bin/ARM-binary:$PATH
	cd /source/dir/of/jruby
	mvn
