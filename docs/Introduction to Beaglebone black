I have used beaglebone black[1] for 'JRuby on Embedded' project. 

Its configuration:
- 512MB DDR3 RAM
- 2GB 8-bit eMMC on-board flash storage
- 3D graphics accelerator
- NEON floating-point accelerator
- 2x PRU 32-bit microcontrollers
- Processor: AM335x 1GHz ARMÂ® Cortex-A8

Supporting operating system:
- Angstrom
- Ubuntu
- Debian
- Android

Lot of material about it can be get on community[2] website. I have to share few of my experience with it.
- Borad can't get brick as you can anytime flash the Sdcard and boot the hardware again when you messed up with its operating system
- The support of the community is prity good
- Board comes with excellent tools like CloudIDE
- The board is very cheap.
- You can use USB to add external input device or storage device.( I used 8GB pendrive with it)
- 512MB RAM and 1GHz processor make it really an powerfull embedded device
